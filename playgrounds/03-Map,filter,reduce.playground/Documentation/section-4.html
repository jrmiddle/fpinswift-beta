    <p>Note that we are using Swift&#39;s syntax for trailing closures again here.</p>
<p>This code is still not as flexible as it could be. Suppose we want to compute a new array of booleans, describing whether the numbers in the original array were even or not. We might try to write something like:</p>
<pre><code>func isEvenArray (xs : [Int]) -&gt; [Bool] {
    computeIntArray(xs){x in x % 2 == 0}
}
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, this code gives a type error. The problem is that our <code>computeIntArray</code> function takes an argument of type <code>Int -&gt; Int</code>, function that computes a new integer. In the definition of <code>isEvenArray</code> we are passing an argument of type <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code> which causes the type error.</p>
<p>How should we solve this? One thing we <em>could</em> do is define a new version of <code>computeIntArray</code> that expects takes a function argument of type <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code>. This might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>func computeBoolArray (xs : [Int], f : Int -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [Bool] {
    let result : [Bool] = []
    for x in xs
    {
        result.append(f(x))
    }
    return result
}
</code></pre><p>This doesn&#39;t scale very well though. What if we need to compute a <code>String</code> next? Do we need to define yet another higher-order function, expecting an argument of type <code>Int -&gt; String</code>?</p>
<p>Luckily there is a solution to this problem: use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Generics.html"><em>generics</em></a>. The definitions of <code>computeBoolArray</code> and <code>computeIntArray</code> are identical; the only difference is in the <em>type signature</em>. If we were to define another version, <code>computeStringArray</code>, the body of the fuction would be the same again. In fact, the same code will work for <em>any</em> type. What we&#39;d really want to do is write a single <em>generic</em> function once and for all, that will work for every possible type.</p>
