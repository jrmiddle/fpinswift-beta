<p>First-class functions are prevalent in Swift&#39;s standard library. Functions that take functions as arguments are sometimes called <em>higher-order</em> functions. In this chapter, we will tour some of the higher-order functions functions on Arrays and Dictionaries from the Swift standard library. By doing so, we will introduce Swift&#39;s <em>generics</em>, which we illustrate by writing a small library inspired by C#&#39;s Language Integrated Queries (LINQ).</p>
<h2 id="introducing-generics">Introducing generics</h2>
<p>Suppose we need to write a function that, given an array of integers, computes a new array, where every integer in the original array has been incremented by one. Such a function is easy to write using a single <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>func incrementArray (xs : [Int]) -&gt; [Int] {
    var result : [Int] = []
    for x in xs
    {
        result.append(x + 1)
    }
    return result
}
</code></pre><p>Now suppose we also need a function that computes a new array, where every element in the argument array has been doubled. This is also easy to do using a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>func doubleArray1 (xs : [Int]) -&gt; [Int] {
    var result : [Int] = []
    for x in xs
    {
        result.append(x * 2)
    }
    return result
}
</code></pre><p>Both these functions share a lot of code. Can we abstract over the differences and write a single, more general function that captures this pattern? Such a function would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>func computeIntArray (xs : [Int]) -&gt; [Int] {
    var result : [Int] = []
    for x in xs
    {
        result.append(... \\ something using x)
    }
    return result
}
</code></pre><p>To complete this definition, we need to add a new argument describing how to compute a new integer from <code>xs[i]</code> -- that is, we need to pass a function as an argument!</p>
