<p>Why write this book? There is plenty of documentation on Swift readily
available from Apple, and there are many more books on the way. Why does the
world need yet another book on yet another programming language?</p>
<p>This book tries to teach you to think <em>functionally</em>. We believe that
Swift has the right language features to teach you how to write
<em>functional programs</em>. But what makes a program functional? Or why
bother learning about this in the first place? In his paper, &quot;Why
Functional Programming Matters,&quot; John Hughes writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functional programming is so called because its fundamental
operation is the application of functions to arguments. A main
program itself is written as a function that receives the program’s
input as its argument and delivers the program’s output as its
result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So rather than thinking of a program as a sequence of assignments and
method calls, functional programmers emphasize that each program can
be repeatedly broken into smaller and smaller pieces. By avoiding
assignment statements and side effects, Hughes argues that functional
programs are more modular than their imperative- or object-oriented
counterparts. And modular code is a Very Good Thing.</p>
<p>In our experience, learning to think functionally is not an easy
thing. It challenges the way we&#39;ve been trained to decompose
problems. For programmers who are used to writing for-loops, recursion can be
confusing; the lack of assignment statements and global state is
crippling; and closures, generics, higher-order functions, and monads are
just plain weird.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, we will assume that you have previous
programming experience in Objective-C (or some other object-oriented
language). We won&#39;t cover Swift basics or teach you to set up your
first XCode project, but we will try to refer to existing Apple
documentation when appropriate. You should be comfortable reading
Swift programs and familiar with common programming concepts, such as
classes, methods, and variables. If you&#39;ve only just started to learn
to program, this may not be the right book for you.</p>
<p>In this book, we want to demystify functional programming and dispel
some of the prejudices people may have against it. You don&#39;t need to
have a PhD in mathematics to use these ideas to improve your code! We
don&#39;t want to claim that functional programming is the <em>only</em> way to
program in Swift. Instead, we believe that learning about functional
programming add an important new tool to your toolbox that will make
you a better developer in any language.</p>
