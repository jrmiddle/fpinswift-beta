    <p>Ideally, we&#39;d like our failing input to be a short as possible. In general, the smaller the counterexample, the easier it is to spot which piece of code is causing the failure. In principle, the user could try to trim the input that triggered the failure and try rerunning the test; rather than place the burden on the user, however, we will automate this process.</p>
<p>To do so, we will make an extra protocol called <code>Smaller</code>, which does only one thing: it tries to shrink the counterexample. </p>
