    <p>As this code evolves, it becomes harder and harder to maintain. This method expresses a complicated calculation in one big lump of code. Let&#39;s try to refactor this into smaller, compositional pieces.</p>
<h2 id="first-class-functions">First-class functions</h2>
<p>There are different approaches to refactoring this code. One obvious pattern would be to introduce a function that computes the distance between two points; or functions that check when two points are &#39;close&#39; or &#39;far away&#39; (for some definition of close and far). In this chapter, however, we&#39;ll take a slightly different approach.</p>
<p>The original problem boiled down to defining a function that determined when a point was in range or not. The type of such a function would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>func pointInRange(point: Position) -&gt; Bool {
    // Implement method here
}
</code></pre><p>The type of this function is going to be so important, that we&#39;re going to give it a separate name:</p>
