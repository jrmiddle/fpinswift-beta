    <p>The way we&#39;ve defined the <code>Region</code> type does have its disadvantages. In particular, we cannot inspect <em>how</em> a region was constructed: is it composed of smaller regions? Or is it simply a circle around the origin? The only thing we can do is to check whether or not a given point is within a region or not. If we would want to visualize a region, we would have to sample enough points to generate a (black and white) bitmap. </p>
<h2 id="type-driven-development">Type-driven development</h2>
<p>In the introduction, we mentioned how functional programs take the application of functions to arguments as the canonical way to assemble bigger programs. In this chapter, we have seen a concrete example of this functional design methodology. We have defined a series of functions for describing regions. Each of these functions is not very powerful by itself. Yet together, they can describe complex regions that you wouldn&#39;t want to write from scratch.</p>
<p>The solution is simple and elegant. It is quite different from what you might write, had you just refactored the <code>inRange4</code> function into separate methods. The crucial design decision we made was <em>how</em> to define regions. Once we chose the <code>Region</code> type, all the other definitions followed naturally. The moral of the example is <strong>choose your types carefully</strong>. More than anything else, types guide the development process. </p>
