<h2 id="what-this-chapter-is-about">What this chapter is about</h2>
<p>Functions in Swift are <em>first-class values</em>, i.e., functions may be passed as arguments to other functions. This idea may seem strange if you&#39;re used to working with simple types, such as integers, booleans or structs. In this chapter, we will try to motivate why first-class functions are useful and give a first example of functional programming in action.</p>
<h2 id="example-battleship">Example: Battleship</h2>
<p>We&#39;ll introduce first-class functions using the example of an algorithm you would implement if you would want to create a Battleship-like game.[^ARPA] The problem we&#39;ll look at boils down to determining whether or not a given point is in range, without being too close to friendly ships or ourselves.</p>
<p>As a first approximation, you might write a very simple function that checks whether or not a point is in range. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that our ship is located at the origin. We can visualize the region we want to describe as follows:</p>

<p>The first function we write, <code>inRange1</code> checks when a point is in the grey area in the picture above. Using some basic geometry, we can write this function as follows:</p>
