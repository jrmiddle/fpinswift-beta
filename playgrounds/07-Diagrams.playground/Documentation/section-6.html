    <p>The code above first describes a blue square, with a relative size of 1. The
red square is twice as big (it has a relative size of 2), and we compose the
diagram by putting the squares and the circle next to each other with the <code>|||</code>
operator. Changing this diagram is very simple, and there&#39;s no need to worry
about calculating frames or moving things around. The examples describe <em>what</em>
should be drawn, not <em>how</em> it should be drawn.</p>
<p>One of the techniques we&#39;ll use in this chapter is building up an intermediate
structure of the diagram. Instead of executing the drawing commands immediately, we build
up a data structure that describes the diagram. This is a very powerful
technique, as it allows us to inspect the data structure, modify it and convert
it into different formats.</p>
<p>As a more complex example of a diagram generated by the same library, here&#39;s a bar graph:</p>
<p><img src="generated/example3.pdf" alt=""></p>
<p>We can write a <code>barGraph</code> function that takes a list of names (the keys) and
values (the relative heights of the bars). For each value, we draw a rectangle,
and horizontally concatenate them with the <code>hcat</code> function. For each name, we
draw it as text, also horizontally concatenate them using <code>hcat</code>, and finally put the bars
and the text below each other using the <code>---</code> operator:</p>
