    <p>It would be very possible to extend this with other primitives, such as images or more complex shapes.</p>
<p>Diagrams are defined using an enum as well. First, a diagram could be a primitive, which has a size and is either an ellipsis, a rectangle or text. Note that we call it <code>Prim</code> because, at the time of writing, the compiler gets confused by a case that has the same name as another enum. </p>
<pre><code>case Prim(CGSize, Primitive)
</code></pre><p>Then, we have cases for diagrams that are beside each other (horizontally) or below each other (vertically). Note how a <code>Beside</code> diagram is defined recursively: it consists of two diagrams next to each other.</p>
<pre><code>case Beside(Diagram,Diagram)
case Below(Diagram,Diagram)
</code></pre><p>To style diagrams, we&#39;ll add a case for attributed diagrams. This allows us to set the fill color (for example, for ellipses and rectangles). We&#39;ll define the <code>Attribute</code> type later.</p>
<pre><code>case Attributed(Attribute,Diagram)
</code></pre><p>The last case is for alignment. Suppose we have a small and a large rectangle that are next to each other. By default, the small rectangle gets centered vertically:</p>

<p>But by adding a case for alignment we can control the alignment of smaller parts of the diagram. </p>
<pre><code>case Align(Vector2D, Diagram)
</code></pre><p>For example, here&#39;s a diagram that&#39;s top-aligned:</p>
<p><img src="generated/example5.pdf" alt=""></p>
<p>It is drawn using the following code:</p>
<pre><code>Diagram.Align(Vector2D(x: 0.5,y: 1), blueSquare) ||| redSquare
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, in the current version of Swift, recursive datatypes are not allowed. So instead of having a <code>Diagram</code> case that contains other <code>Diagram</code>s, we created an extra protocol <code>DiagramLike</code>, and change our <code>Diagram</code> definition accordingly:</p>
