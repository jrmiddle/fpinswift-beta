<p>First-class functions are prevalent in Swift&#39;s standard library. Functions that take functions as arguments are sometimes called <em>higher-order</em> functions. In this chapter, we will tour some of the higher-order functions functions on Arrays from the Swift standard library. By doing so, we will introduce Swift&#39;s <em>generics</em> and show how to write assemble complex computations on arrays.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-generics">Introducing generics</h2>
<p>Suppose we need to write a function that, given an array of integers, computes a new array, where every integer in the original array has been incremented by one. Such a function is easy to write using a single <code>for</code> loop:</p>
