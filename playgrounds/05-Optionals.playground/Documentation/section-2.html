    <p>Similar to the previous example in Chapter 3, this dictionary stores the population of several European cities. In this example, the key <code>&quot;Paris&quot;</code> is associated with the value <code>2243</code>; that is, Paris has about <code>2243000</code> inhabitants.</p>
<p>Like arrays, the <code>Dictionary</code> type is generic. The type of dictionaries is generic in two arguments: the types of the stored keys and values. In our example, the city dictionary has type <code>Dictionary&lt;String,Int&gt;</code>. There is also a shorthand notation, <code>[String : Int]</code>.</p>
<p>We can lookup the value associated with a key using the same notation as array indexing:</p>
<pre><code>let madridPopulation : Int = cities[&quot;Madrid&quot;]
</code></pre><p>This example, however, does not type check. The problem is that the key <code>&quot;Madrid&quot;</code> may not be in the <code>cities</code> dictionary -- and what value should be returned if it is not? We cannot guarantee that the dictionary lookup operation <em>always</em> returns an <code>Int</code> for every key. Swift&#39;s <em>optional</em> types track the possibility of failure. The correct way to write the example above would be:</p>
