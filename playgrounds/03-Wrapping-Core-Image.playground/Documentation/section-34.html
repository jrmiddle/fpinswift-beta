    <p>In the first case, we pass both arguments to <code>add1</code> at the same time; in the second, we first pass the first argument <code>1</code>, which returns a function, which we apply to the second argument <code>2</code>. Both versions are equivalent: we can define <code>add1</code> in terms of <code>add2</code> and visa versa.</p>
<p>In this fashion, we can always transform a function that expects multiple arguments into a series of functions that each expect one argument. This process is referred to as <em>currying</em>, named after the logician Haskell Curry; we say that <code>add2</code> is the <em>curried</em> version of <code>add1</code>. The popular functional programming language Haskell, which you may have heard of, is also named after Haskell Curry.</p>
<p>In Swift, we can even leave out some of the parentheses in the type signature of <code>add2</code>, and write:</p>
