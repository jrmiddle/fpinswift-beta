<p>This library is far from complete, but already quite useful. There are a couple of obvious things that could be improved:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Arbitrary instances are quite simple. For different datatypes, we might want to have more complicated arbitrary instances. For example, when generating arbitrary enum values, we might want to generate certain cases with different frequencies. We might also want to generate constrained values (for example, what if we want to test a function that expects sorted arrays?). When writing multiple <code>Arbitrary</code> instances, we might want to define some helper functions that aid us in writing these instances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We might want to classify the generated test data. For example, if we generate a lot of arrays of length 1, we could classify this as a &#39;trivial&#39; test case. The Haskell library has support for classification, these ideas could be ported directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other small and large things that could be improved to make this into a full library.</p>
