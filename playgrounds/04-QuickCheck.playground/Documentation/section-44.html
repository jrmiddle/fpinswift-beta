    <p>Now what we&#39;d like to do is define an extension that uses the <code>abritraryArray</code> function to give the desired <code>Arbitrary</code> instance for arrays. However, to define an instance for <code>Array</code>, we also need to make sure that the element type of the array is also an instance of <code>Arbitrary</code>. For example, in order to generate an array of random numbers, we first need to make sure that we can generate random numbers. Ideally, we would write something like this, saying that the elements of an array should also conform to the arbitrary protocol:</p>
<pre><code>extension Array&lt;T: Arbitrary&gt; : Arbitrary {
    static func arbitrary() -&gt; [T] {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to express this restriction as a type constraint, making it impossible to write an extension that makes <code>Array</code> conform to the <code>Arbitrary</code> protocol. Instead we will modify the <code>check2</code> function.</p>
<p>The problem with the <code>check2&lt;A&gt;</code> function was that it required the type <code>A</code> to be <code>Arbitrary</code>. We will drop this requirement, and instead require the necessary functions, <code>smaller</code> and <code>arbitrary</code>, to be passed as arguments.</p>
<p>We start by defining an auxiliary struct that contains the two functions we need:</p>
