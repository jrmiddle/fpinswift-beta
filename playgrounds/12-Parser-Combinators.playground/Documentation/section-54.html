    <p>Now we just have to create a function that combines these two parsers and returns a new parser, so that the function yielded by <code>integerParser</code> gets applied to the character &quot;3&quot; yielded by the symbol parser. This function looks very similar to the <code>sequence</code> function -- it calls <code>flatMap</code> on the sequence returned by the first parser and then maps over the sequence returned by the second parser applied to the remainder. </p>
<p>The key difference is that the inner closure does not return the results of both parsers in a tuple as <code>sequence</code> did, but it applies the function yielded by the first parser to the result of the second parser:</p>
