    <p>The second for loop is not producing any output -- what went wrong? The problem is in the definition of concatenation on sequences. We assemble the desired generator, <code>l.generate() + r.generate()</code>. This generator produces all the desired elements in the first loop in the example above. Once it has been exhausted, however, traversing the compound sequence a second time will not produce a fresh generator, but instead use the generator that has already been exhausted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this problem is easy to fix. We need to ensure that the result of our concatenation operation can produce new generators. To do so, we pass a <em>function</em> that produces generators, rather than a fixed generator to the <code>SequenceOf</code> initializer:</p>
