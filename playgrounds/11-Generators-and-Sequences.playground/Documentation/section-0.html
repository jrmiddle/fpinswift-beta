<h2 id="what-this-chapter-is-about">What this chapter is about</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we&#39;ll look at generators and sequences. These form the machinery underlying Swift&#39;s for-loops and will be the basis of our parsing library, that we will present in the following chapters.</p>
<h2 id="generators">Generators</h2>
<p>In Objective-C and Swift, we almost always use the Array datatype to represent a list of items. It is both simple and fast. There are situations, however, where Arrays are not suitable. For example, you might not want to calculate all the elements of an the Array – because there are infinitely many or you don’t expect to use them all. In such situations, you may want to use a <em>generator</em> instead.</p>
<p>We will try to provide some motivation for generators, using familiar examples from array computations. Swift&#39;s for-loops can be used to iterate over array elements:</p>
